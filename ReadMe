# Site Watch

Site Watch is a productivity-focused browser extension that tracks how much time you spend on different websites. The extension automatically pauses tracking when Chrome is inactive (e.g., when you switch to another application) and resumes tracking when Chrome regains focus, ensuring accurate time measurement.

This tool helps you understand your browsing habits, manage your time effectively, provide daily usage summary, and avoid distractions.
